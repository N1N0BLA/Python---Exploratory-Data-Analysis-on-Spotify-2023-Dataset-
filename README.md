## üö© PROBLEM 1
### Overview of Dataset

```python

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv',encoding='latin1')

# Displays a summary of the DataFrame's structure, including the index range, column names, non-null counts, data types, and memory usage.
df.info()

# This calculates total number of missing (NaN) values for each column in the DataFrame and is placed in missing_values.
missing_values1 = df.isnull().sum()

# This prints out missing_values.
print(missing_values1)
```
#### Explanation:
- **`pd.read_csv()`**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame named `df`.
- **`df.info()`**: Displays a summary of the DataFrame's structure, including the index range, column names, non-null counts, data types, and memory usage.
- **`missing_values1 = df.isnull().sum()`**: This calculates total number of missing (NaN) values for each column in the DataFrame and is placed in missing_values.
- **`print(missing_values1)`**: This prints out missing_values.

 ###### Note: encoding='latin1' is required to load the given dataset since the given file is not using a default UTF-8 encoding. The latin1 encoding can handle a wider range of byte values and is often used for files with Western European characters which is useful in loading this dataset.

  ###### Note: These 2 pairs of code are used to check the results after removing the duplicates and the null values
- **`missing_values2 = df.isnull().sum()`**
- **`print(missing_values2)`**

- **`missing_values3 = df.isnull().sum()`**
- **`print(missing_values3)`**

#### 1. Identifying and Displaying Duplicates
```python
# Identifies and removes duplicate rows based on artist and track names
dup = df[df.duplicated(['artist(s)_name', 'track_name'])]  # Finds duplicates
print("Duplicate tracks in this dataset are: ")
print(dup)  # Displays duplicate rows found
```
Code: **`dup = df[df.duplicated(['artist(s)_name', 'track_name'])]`**
- Function: Finds rows with duplicate artist(s)_name and track_name and stores them in dup.
- Purpose: Identifies duplicates for review before removal.

#### 2. Sorting and Removing Duplicates (Keeping the Best One):
```
df.sort_values(by=['artist(s)_name', 'track_name', 'streams', 'in_spotify_playlists'], ascending=[True, True, False, False], inplace=True)
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['artist(s)_name', 'track_name'], keep='first')  # Drops duplicates

df = df.dropna()
missing_values3 = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values3)
```
Dropping Rows with Missing Values:
Code: **`df = df.dropna()`**
- Function: Removes any rows in the DataFrame df that contain missing (NaN) values.
- Purpose: Cleans the dataset by dropping rows with incomplete data.
  
Checking Remaining Missing Values:
Code: **`missing_values3 = df.isnull().sum()`**
- Function: Calculates the number of missing values (NaN) for each column in the DataFrame df after the dropna() operation.
- Purpose: Checks if any missing values remain in the dataset after dropping rows.

Code: **`print(missing_values3)`**
- Function: Prints the count of missing values for each column.
- Purpose: Displays the results to verify if any missing data is left.

Note: These were used to check the results on missing values
**`missing_values3 = df.isnull().sum()`**

Sorting for better visualization on the next problem:
```
df = df.sort_values(by='streams', ascending = False).reset_index(drop=True)
df
```
Code: **`df = df.sort_values(by='streams', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)`**
- Function: Sorts the DataFrame df by the streams column in descending order and resets the index, dropping the old index.

#### üìä CHART ANALYSIS:
1. **Trends in the Number of Tracks Released Over Time**
- Overall Pattern: The chart on the left, "Number of Tracks Released Per Year," shows that the number of track releases remained low and relatively stable from the early 1900s until the early 2000s.
- Sharp Increase: Starting around 2010, there is a notable upward trend, with a dramatic spike after 2020. This sharp increase likely reflects either a rise in music production, a more comprehensive dataset for recent years, or a shift to digital platforms that has facilitated greater accessibility and recording frequency.
- Peak and Decline: The highest point appears to be around 2022, after which there is a slight drop. This peak could be due to data collection factors or reflect an actual decline in releases for the most recent year.

2. **Patterns in the Number of Tracks Released Per Month**
- Monthly Release Patterns: The "Number of Tracks Released Per Month" chart shows variation in releases across different months, with some months consistently seeing more releases than others.
- Most Releases in May: May has the highest number of releases, standing out above all other months. January also has a high number of releases, but it's slightly lower than May.
- Other Observations: There is no clear seasonality that would suggest that certain quarters of the year are significantly more active, though May appears to be a prominent month for releases. The summer months, particularly June, July, and August, show a slight dip in the number of releases.

Code: **`plt.show()`**
- Function: Displays the heatmap plot.
- Purpose: To render the plot and make it visible.


#### üìä CHART ANALYSIS:
1. Correlation Between Streams and Musical Attributes
- **Danceability%**: The correlation between streams and danceability_% is low, with a coefficient around -0.09 in the left matrix and -0.094 in the right matrix. This suggests a weak and slightly negative relationship, indicating that higher danceability does not necessarily lead to more streams.
- **Energy%**: The energy_% attribute shows an even weaker correlation with streams, with a value of -0.04 in the left matrix and -0.036 in the right matrix. This near-zero value indicates virtually no relationship between a track‚Äôs energy level and its number of streams.
- **BPM**: The bpm attribute has a negligible correlation with streams, approximately -0.02 to -0.025 across both matrices. This minimal value shows that tempo, represented by bpm, has almost no effect on the streaming numbers.
Overall, none of these musical attributes (danceability, energy, bpm) have a strong influence on the number of streams. The weak correlations suggest that other factors beyond these musical features likely play a more significant role in determining a track‚Äôs popularity.

2. Correlation Between Danceability% and Energy%, and Valence% and Acousticness%
- Danceability% and Energy%: The correlation between danceability_% and energy_% is moderate and positive, with values around 0.16 in both matrices. This indicates that tracks with higher danceability tend to also have slightly higher energy levels, though the relationship is not strong.
- Valence% and Acousticness%: The correlation between valence_% and acousticness_% is moderate and negative, approximately -0.55 in both matrices. This negative correlation suggests that more acoustic tracks tend to have lower valence (less positive emotion) and vice versa.

### Streams by Key and Mode, Artist Playlist and Chart Appearances
Descriptive Statistics by Key and Mode
```python
# Group by 'key' and 'mode', then calculate mean, median, std, and percentiles
grouped_stats = df.groupby(['key', 'mode'])['streams'].agg(
    mean='mean',
    median='median',
    std='std',
    q25=lambda x: x.quantile(0.25),
    q75=lambda x: x.quantile(0.75)
).reset_index()

print(grouped_stats)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='key', y='streams', hue='mode', palette='Set2')
plt.title('Distribution of Streams by Key and Mode')
plt.xlabel('Key')
plt.ylabel('Streams')
plt.yscale('log')  # Log scale for better visibility
plt.legend(title='Mode')
plt.show()

```
Code: **`grouped_stats = df.groupby(['key', 'mode'])['streams'].agg(...)`**
- Function: Groups the data by key and mode, then calculates mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles (25th and 75th percentiles) for streams.
- Purpose: To explore how streams vary across different musical keys and modes (e.g., major/minor scales).

Code: **`sns.boxplot(data=df, x='key', y='streams', hue='mode', ...)`**
- Function: Creates a box plot to visualize the distribution of streams by key and mode.
- Purpose: To compare the spread and central tendency of streams across different keys and modes.

Code: **`plt.show()`**
- Function: Displays the box plot.
- Purpose: To render and show the plot for the distribution of streams by key and mode.

### CHART USAGE: Why was a boxplot graph utilized?
- Using mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles will give a fuller picture of the distribution within each key and mode.
- This approach lets you identify if certain keys or modes tend to have a higher median or average stream count, while also spotting high variability or skewness.
  
#### üìä CHART ANALYSIS:
- The highest streaming numbers appear in C# and D keys, particularly in major mode
- Several keys show notable high outliers, reaching up to 10^10 streams
- Major mode generally shows higher median streams across most keys 
- F and F# keys show the lowest median streaming numbers
- Minor mode consistently shows lower streaming numbers compared to major
- The lowest streams are around 104 to 105 range

#### üìä CHART ANALYSIS:

##### Analysis of Artists by Playlist Appearances

- Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift are the most prominent artists in playlists, with high appearance counts, indicating their strong presence and popularity across various user-created or algorithmic playlists.
- Other artists on this list, such as Eminem, Coldplay, and Dr. Dre (Snoop Dogg), suggest a mix of genres‚Äîranging from pop, hip-hop, rap, rock, and electronic.
- Artists like Avicii and Daft Punk represent electronic and dance genres, which often perform well in playlist settings, possibly due to their suitability for mood-based playlists.
- Nirvana and Adele, representing rock and pop respectively, also show strong playlist appearances, indicating broad appeal across diverse listener groups.

##### Analysis of Artists by Chart Appearances
- Taylor Swift has the highest number of chart appearances by a significant margin, which suggests her consistent charting success and popularity across demographics.
- Bad Bunny and SZA are other top-charting artists, indicating the popularity of Latin music and R&B in mainstream charts.
- Newer artists like Olivia Rodrigo and NewJeans are also prominent, reflecting the influence of recent trends and younger audiences.
- A more varied genre representation is evident here with artists like Dave, Central Cee (UK rap), and Latto (hip-hop), suggesting that hip-hop and rap are well-represented in charts.
  
##### Comparing Playlist and Chart Appearances
- Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran appear in both the playlist and chart lists, showing that they have a consistent presence across both metrics.
- Genres: Pop, hip-hop, and rap artists appear frequently in both playlists and charts, indicating that these genres have broad appeal and adaptability.
- Diverse Popularity: Some artists like Bad Bunny and SZA perform better in charts but aren't as prominent in playlists, possibly reflecting their recent surge in mainstream popularity rather than organic playlist curation.
- Electronic/Dance Music: Artists like Avicii and Daft Punk appear mainly in playlists, which may suggest that while they are popular in curated listening experiences, they might not have as consistent chart performance.

##### Conclusion
- Pop and hip-hop/rap artists consistently appear in both playlists and charts, showing their wide-reaching appeal. However, certain genres, such as electronic, seem more playlist-oriented, while newer artists or genre-specific stars (like Latin or R&B) are more prevalent in charts. This analysis highlights the evolving - - popularity dynamics between mainstream charts and curated playlists, driven by both legacy artists and rising stars.
