This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify 2023 Dataset for the course *Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms (ECE 2112)* at the University of Santo Tomas, Faculty of Engineering. The experiment focuses on using Python's Pandas library for data analysis, Matplot and Seaborn for better analyzation and presentation of data.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret a dataset of music tracks to extract meaningful insights about track popularity and musical trends. The analysis involves exploring track features, identifying trends in release patterns, examining relationships between musical characteristics and popularity, and generating recommendations based on findings.

## Objectives
### 1. Understand the Dataset Structure
- Load and inspect the dataset, checking for missing values, data types, and the general structure.
  
### 2.Clean and Prepare Data
Convert columns to appropriate data types and handle missing values to ensure accurate analysis.

### 3.Compute Summary Statistics
Provide descriptive statistics on key metrics like streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).

### 4.Explore Data with Visualizations
Create charts (bar plots, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in streaming data, release dates, artist frequency, and musical attributes.

### 5.Perform Correlation Analysis
Analyze correlations between streams and other musical attributes (like BPM, energy, danceability) to determine what factors may influence popularity.

### 6.Analyze Trends in Release Patterns
Investigate the distribution of track releases over time, identifying any yearly or monthly patterns.

### 7.Identify Popular Tracks and Artists
Highlight the most-streamed tracks and frequently occurring artists, exploring what makes them stand out.

### 8.Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, provide insights and recommendations about music trends, characteristics of popular tracks, and artist patterns.
